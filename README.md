## Hi there 👋
Thank's for stopping by 🙂

I am Edoardo Ferretto, MSc graduate in Quantitative Finance.

#### 🔭 Currently working on
These are the projects I published thus far:
- [Quant-Energy-Pricer](https://github.com/edofe99/Quant-Energy-Pricer): a quantitative pricing tool, written in Python, that allows to price energetic full-load contracts. The whole approach is documented on my MSc thesis (about to be published in Sept 2025). 
- [Implied Volatility Dashboard](https://github.com/edofe99/implied-volatility-dashboard): an interactive dashboard to visualise the Implied Volatility surface of a given financial instrument.
- [Forex economic calendar webscraper](https://github.com/edofe99/forex-economic-calendar-webscraper): used Selenium to scrap economic data for forex pairs.
- [Finance Tracker built with Streamlit](https://github.com/edofe99/streamlit-finance-tracker): my first experiment on creating user interfaces using Streamlit. You can try it directly on your browser.

#### 🌱 Currently learning
- After reaching a satisfiying level with Python, I'm now learning C++.
- Working on some personal projects that I'll publish here once I'm satisfied with the end result.
